## Introduction
<p style="text-align:justify;">Utilizing the full potential of hardware acceleration has become critical in today's digital landscape, 
where data processing and computational capacity are critical for a wide range of applications. Nvidia CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) has emerged as a game-changing technology, 
allowing developers to take advantage of massive parallel processing capabilities of Nvidia GPUs (Graphics Processing Units). In this blog post, we will dive into the world of CUDA compatibility, 
learning about its significance, benefits, and application. I will also provide a basic tutorial to install CUDA in Linux operating system.</p>

## Understanding Nvidia CUDA Compatibility
<p style="text-align:justify;">CUDA compatibility refers to the ability of a software or application to run and utilize the parallel processing capabilities of Nvidia GPUs. 
By tapping into the massive computational power of GPUs, CUDA empowers developers to accelerate their algorithms and computations, 
achieving significant performance gains compared to traditional CPU-based processing.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Nvidia CUDA compatibility is not limited to a specific programming language. 
It provides developers with powerful APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) and libraries that allow them to seamlessly 
integrate CUDA functionality into their existing codebase. The CUDA programming model supports popular languages such as C, C++, and Fortran, 
making it accessible to a broad community of developers.</p>

## Applications of Nvidia CUDA Compatibility
* <p style="text-align:justify;">Scientific and Technical Computing: CUDA compatibility is extensively used in scientific simulations, weather modeling, fluid dynamics,
  and molecular dynamics, among others. These fields require intensive computations,
  and leveraging GPUs through CUDA can significantly accelerate the processing of complex algorithms and simulations.</p>
* <p style="text-align:justify;">Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence: The field of machine learning heavily relies on the efficient processing
  of massive datasets and complex neural networks. CUDA compatibility enables researchers and data scientists to
  train deep learning models faster, making GPU-accelerated machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch popular
  choices for AI development.</p>
* <p style="text-align:justify;">Video and Image Processing: CUDA compatibility is widely employed in video transcoding, image recognition, and computer
  vision applications. The parallel processing capabilities of GPUs facilitate real-time video processing, object detection,
  and advanced image filtering, providing a substantial boost to multimedia applications.</p>
* <p style="text-align:justify;">Financial Modeling and Quantitative Analysis: Financial institutions utilize CUDA compatibility to accelerate
  complex risk calculations, option pricing, and portfolio analysis. By harnessing GPU parallelism,
  traders and analysts can perform high-speed simulations and gain insights into vast amounts of financial data.</p>

## Issues with CUDA Version
<p style="text-align:justify;">As we all knows,Tensorflow and PyTorch are extenssively used for machine learning and deep learnig model devlopement. The particular version of both are compartibible with a particular cuda version (e.g. - 10.x, 11.x or 12.x). Hence, it is necessary one has installed the required nvidia driver for the GPU with required CUDA version. This caused device failure and run time errors.</p>
