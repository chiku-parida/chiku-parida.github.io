I am a doctoral researcher at the [DTU Energy](https://www.energy.dtu.dk/){:target="_blank"}. I am working on inverse design of solid electrolytes for solid-state-batteries (for detail description please go to my research section). I am working with [Prof. Juan Maria García Lastra](https://orbit.dtu.dk/en/persons/juan-maria-garc%C3%ADa-lastra){:target="_blank"} and [Dr. Arghya Bhowmik](https://orbit.dtu.dk/en/persons/arghya-bhowmik){:target="_blank"}. They are my supervisers at [DTU](https://www.dtu.dk/){:target="_blank"}. This project is associated with the [University of Queensland](https://aibn.uq.edu.au/){:target="_blank"}. [Prof. Debra Bernhardt](https://aibn.uq.edu.au/bernhardt){:target="_blank"} is co-supervising the project.

I am extremely grateful to receive funding from the following sources:     
* Technical University of Denmark - DTU 
* ALLIANCE Grant
