I am a doctoral researcher at [DTU Energy](https://www.energy.dtu.dk/){:target="_blank"}. I am working on the inverse design of solid electrolytes for solid-state batteries (for a detailed description, please go to my research section). I am working with [Prof. Juan Maria Garc√≠a Lastra](https://orbit.dtu.dk/en/persons/juan-maria-garc%C3%ADa-lastra){:target="_blank"} and [Dr. Arghya Bhowmik](https://orbit.dtu.dk/en/persons/arghya-bhowmik){:target="_blank"}. They are my supervisors at [DTU](https://www.dtu.dk/){:target="_blank"}. This project is associated with the [University of Queensland](https://aibn.uq.edu.au/){:target="_blank"}. [Prof. Debra Bernhardt](https://aibn.uq.edu.au/bernhardt){:target="_blank"} is co-supervising the project.

I am extremely grateful to receive funding from the following sources:     
* Technical University of Denmark - DTU 
* ALLIANCE Grant

* I am selected for Generative Materials Summer School([GeMSS](https://gemss.ai/){:target="_blank"}), which is going to happen at [Pioneer Centre for Artificial Intelligence](https://www.aicentre.dk/){:target="_blank"}. The summer school targets young researchers (PhD, Postdoc and Research Engineers) who are weeling to use generative models for their research projects. I am going to present a poster in the event. 

* Attended CECAM conference on [Open Databases Integration for Materials Design](https://www.cecam.org/workshop-details/1208){:target="_blank"}. The conference and workshop is about the usage and implementation of [OPTIMADE API](https://www.optimade.org/) for high-throughput materials discovery.
