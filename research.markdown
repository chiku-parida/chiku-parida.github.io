### Technical University of Denmark (DTU)
#### Deep Generative Models for Inverse Design of Solid Electrolytes ([PhD Project](https://orbit.dtu.dk/en/projects/deep-generative-models-for-inverse-design-of-solid-electrolytes){:target="_blank"})

<p style="text-align:justify;">Generative models for inverse design of materials refer to a class of machine learning models that are used to create new materials with desired properties. These models utilize deep learning techniques to generate novel material structures or compositions based on input specifications, such as desired physical or chemical properties.</p>


<p style="text-align:justify;">Deep generative models can be trained on large databases of existing materials with known properties to learn patterns and correlations between material structures and their corresponding properties. Once trained, the models can be used for inverse design by specifying desired material properties as input and generating new material structures that exhibit those properties.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The applications of generative models for inverse design of materials are broad and diverse. They can be used to design materials with specific mechanical, thermal, electrical, or optical properties, accelerating the discovery of new materials for various industries such as energy, electronics, and healthcare. Additionally, these models can aid in the exploration of vast materials design spaces, providing valuable insights and guidance for experimental synthesis and optimization processes.</p>

### Before the PhD 

#### JNCASR

At Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research ([JNCASR](https://www.jncasr.ac.in/home){:target="_blank"} I worked in a year long project on atomistic modelling of solid-liquid interface. The project is supervised by [Prof. Shobhana Narasimhan](https://www.jncasr.ac.in/faculty/shobhana){:target="_blank"} and suppuorted by our collaborators, [Dr. Brandon C. Wood](https://qsg.llnl.gov/Site/BrandonWood.html){:target="_blank"} and [Dr. Shubham Sharma](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shubham-sharma-690246a4){:target="_blank"} at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory ([LLNL](https://www.llnl.gov/){:target="_blank"}). In the project I have studied the dissolution of platinum in water using first principle calculations.
